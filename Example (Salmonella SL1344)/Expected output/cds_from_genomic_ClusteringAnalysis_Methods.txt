METHODS ADDENDUM — CLUSTER OVERLAY PLOTTING (APPENDED)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cluster overlay figures were generated by plotting genes at their 2D embedding coordinates and highlighting curated cluster members. Local density fields were estimated on a grid and smoothed with a Gaussian kernel; enrichment was computed as the ratio (or log2-ratio) between cluster density and global density (where applicable). Key plotting settings are reported in the Methods details file.

Output figure (best-effort filename): cds_from_genomic_ClusteringAnalysis_UMAP_local_ENRICH_log2_unilateral_diverging.png
